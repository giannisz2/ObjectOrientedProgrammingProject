# ObjectOrientedProgrammingProject

This is the repository of the project in Object Orianted Proggraming, University of Athens.

It's an "RPG" that contains a board with the main player "Avatar" and two set of entities that fight each other(WareWolves and Vampires).
The entities move randomly and have random stats. If two different entities meet, they destroy each other depending on the stats. If two entities of the same species meet, they heal the other if necessary. The Avatar can choose a team and move freely on the map, blocking paths or healing allies.
